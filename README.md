# CPSC 484 Final Project
## Group 13, TV 2

### Description
For our project, users can utilize a web-app to take part in a quick and enjoyable tea-making activity where their body movements are used to control a virtual tea-making activity on the TV screen. The installation focuses on two tasks: the first is the need to incorporate simple physical activity into the day and get moving in order provide a break in the life of a student. This technique also handles the second job, which is to comprehend crucial elements of sustaining positive mental health and setting aside the time to do so. Making tea provides the user with a quick, stress-free pastime to take a break from other stress-inducing aspects of their day.

### Constraints from physical environment:
We tested and developed our project at TV 2, so our implementation may behave differently in different locations or on different display setups. Our implementation is also contrained by the capabilities of the Kinect skeletal tracking system, which we rely on for user input.

### Dependencies
