# CPSC 484 Final Project
## Group 13, TV 2

### Description
For our project, users can utilize a web-app to take part in a quick and enjoyable tea-making activity where their body movements are used to control the completion of the chai recipe. The installation focuses on two tasks: the first is the need to incorporates small physical movements, which provides users with a way to include physical activity in their day without having to block out a large chunk of time specifically to exercise. This technique also handles the second job, which is to provide a transient way to promote positive mental health. Making tea provides the user with a quick, stress-free activity to take a break from other stress-inducing aspects of their day. Additionally, the information provided at the end of the interaction tells the user about the importance of maintaining good mental health, and the chai instructions provided through the QR code gives the user a stress-relieving activity to continue at home if they wish to do so.


### Constraints from physical environment:
We tested and developed our project at TV 2, so our implementation may behave differently in different locations or on different display setups. Our implementation is also contrained by the capabilities of the Kinect skeletal tracking system, which we rely on for user input.
